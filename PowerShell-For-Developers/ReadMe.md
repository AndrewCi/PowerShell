# PowerShell for Developers

The code in this area is part of my **PowerShell For Developers** presentation. The files are numbered in the order in which they are presented during the presentation. 

Some of the code demos create output files, I have included those as well for your reference. 

For ease of use, all demos and samples were bundled into one easy to download ZIP file.
