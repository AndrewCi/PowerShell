  All information was accurate at the time of the demo creation. 
  
  The scripts have been tested against AzureRM Version 4.1.0.

  Note that things are changing very rapidly in the world of Azure in 
  general and Azure's PowerShell modules in particular, so be sure
  to check Microsoft online documentation for the latest information.
  
  The files contained in this repository are for educational purposes
  only. They are meant to illustrate the use of PowerShell and 
  Azure. 

  Be aware, there are actually two methods of accessing Azure, 
  ASM (Azure Service Management) and ARM (Azure Resource Manager). 
  ASM is going to be retired, replaced by ARM. Thus for all demos
  in this repository we'll be using the ARM version of modules
  and cmdlets. 
  
  Note, the Azure SQL demo used a sample database called 
  TeenyTinyDB, which you can find on this site at:
  https://github.com/arcanecode/TeenyTinyDB
  
  However, you can substitute any database you wish to use. The
  TeenyTinyDB was designed to be small so you could quickly learn
  the import/export functions of Azure SQL without wating a long time.
